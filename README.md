## Notes
- This repository is equipped with an renv lockfile recording all versions of R packages used in the analysis. If you wish to replicate our environment, use renv::restore() prior to running any portion of the code.

As of Oct 14, 2024, the status of the renv was the following:
```
> renv::status()
No issues found -- the project is in a consistent state.
```

- Scripts under `scripts/02_analysis` and `scripts/03_content` are the most relevant to recreate our findings, figures, and tables.


For questions about how to use the data or code, contact the lead author and owner of this GitHub repository.
