\caption{\label{tab:biophysical_vs_effect}\textbf{Regression coefficients testing for the biogeographic, climate refugia, and adaptation hypothesis.}
             The slope represents the coefficient of interest on the variable relevant to each hypothesis. First column shows slope on distance from 25Â°N.
             Second column is slope on the coefficient of variation of historical (1982-2013) SST.
             The third column is the slope on variation of historical fiheries production (2000-2013).}
